# Understanding Common Software and Robotics Licenses

As a software or robotics developer, it's important to know about licenses that determine how you can use, modify, or share code and designs. Here's a quick overview of the most common licenses you might encounter:

---

## **1. MIT License**
- **What it means:**
  - You can use the code however you want, even in your own projects or products.
  - You don't need to share your changes or pay the original creator.
  - Thereâ€™s no warranty; the creator isnâ€™t responsible if something goes wrong.
- **Best for:** Sharing code freely and encouraging innovation.

---

## **2. GPL (GNU General Public License)**
- **What it means:**
  - You can use the code, but if you modify or use it in your project, you *must* share your project under the same license.
  - It ensures that all versions of the code stay open-source.
- **Best for:** Projects that prioritize openness and sharing improvements.

---

## **3. Apache License 2.0**
- **What it means:**
  - You can use the code for any purpose, including commercial projects.
  - You must give credit to the original creator.
  - If you make changes, you need to clearly document them.
- **Best for:** Projects that want to allow flexibility while giving proper credit.

---

## **4. BSD License (Simplified)**
- **What it means:**
  - You can use the code freely and mention the original creator if you share it.
  - You canâ€™t use the creator's name to promote your project without permission.
- **Best for:** Similar to MIT but with added rules about attribution.

---

## **5. Creative Commons (CC Licenses)**
- **What it means:**
  - Used for non-code content like images, designs, or tutorials.
  - Different CC licenses may allow or restrict things like modifications or commercial use.
- **Best for:** Sharing designs, documentation, or media in robotics projects.

## **Why This Matters**
Understanding these licenses helps you:
1. Know how to legally use othersâ€™ work in your projects.
2. Avoid legal issues when sharing or selling your projects.
3. Decide how you want to share your own work with others.

**Tip:** Always check the license of any code, design, or file you use in your project. If youâ€™re sharing your work, choose a license that fits your goals!
